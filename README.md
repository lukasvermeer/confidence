## What's this?
It's a game, created by Lukas Vermeer. You can see the original over at https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/confidence/

## What have you done to it?
- Removed arcade mode
- Removed login and leaderboard capabilities
- Added some branding
- Turned topics into site areas and gave them their own traffic volumes and conversion rates
- Added revenue delta to experiments based on a standard AOV
- Minor style changes
- In my weakness, I turned p-values into a confidence calculation, forgive me stats gods
